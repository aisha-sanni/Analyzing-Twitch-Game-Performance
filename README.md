### Overview
In today’s data-driven environment, businesses need intuitive dashboards to understand performance trends quickly. To demonstrate the power of Excel for data storytelling, I created an interactive dashboard using Adidas’ U.S. sales data. This project focuses on transforming raw transaction-level data into visual insights that can drive strategic decisions.
### Objectives
The primary objective of this project was to analyze Adidas’ sales trends across the United States using Excel. The goal was to identify profitable regions, sales channels, and product categories that can inform future business decisions.

This Excel dashboard serves as a decision-support tool that stakeholders — from marketing teams to executive leadership — can use to make informed, data-backed choices.
### Tools Used
Microsoft Excel - For data cleaning, pivot analysis, charts and dashboard
### Key Insights
- In-store sales channels account for the highest overall sales volume, while outlet stores offer better profit margins, making both vital yet distinct strategic priorities.


- Men’s Street Footwear and Women’s Running Footwear emerged as top-performing product categories, especially in high-density regions like the Northeast and West.


- Certain retailers like Foot Locker and Dick’s Sporting Goods consistently outperform others in both sales and profitability, while Walmart’s high volume, low-margin model may need recalibration.


- Seasonality plays a significant role, with sales peaking in the final quarter of the year, reinforcing the need for time-sensitive marketing and inventory planning.
