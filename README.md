### Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Twitch game data from 2016 to 2024 using Excel. The goal was to uncover viewer engagement trends, streaming activity, and game performance patterns. By transforming raw data into an interactive Excel dashboard, I provided actionable insights that help streamers identify high-performing games, assist developers in planning releases, and support analysts in spotting under-the-radar titles. The dashboard includes KPIs, charts, and slicers for dynamic exploration—making the data both accessible and decision-driven.
